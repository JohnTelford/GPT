They are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transmit information.</p> <p>Structure A neural network typically consists of three types of layers: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.</p> <p>The input layer is responsible for receiving and encoding the input data, which can be numerical, categorical, or image data. The hidden layer(s) perform computational tasks based on the input data, and through training, learn to identify relevant features within the input data by adjusting the weights and biases associated with each neuron. The output layer provides a prediction or classification based on this learned information. Training Neural networks need to be trained using large datasets of labeled examples. During training, the network's parameters \u2013 weights and biases \u2013 are adjusted iteratively to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and actual outputs. This process, called backpropagation, involves taking the error gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights, and updating those weights accordingly using gradient descent or similar optimization methods.</p> <p>Applications Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other areas where pattern recognition or classification is needed.</p> <p>That conservatism stemmed in part from the unpredictability of the neural network, the computing paradigm that modern AI is based on, which is inspired by the human brain. Instead of the traditional approach to computer programming, which relies on precise sets of instructions yielding predictable results, neural networks effectively teach themselves to spot patterns in data. The more data and computing power these networks are fed, the more capable they tend to become.</p> <p>In the early 2010s, Silicon Valley woke up to the idea that neural networks were a far more promising route to powerful AI than old-school programming.

It is called \"backward\" because it begins at the output layer and works backwards through the layers until it reaches the input layer.</p> <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate how backward propagation works:</p> <p>Suppose we have a neural network with one hidden layer that takes two inputs, x1 and x2, and produces one output, y. The network has the following weights and biases:</p> <ul> <li>w1 = 0.5</li> <li>w2 = -0.3</li> <li>b1 = 0.4</li> <li>w3 = 0.2</li> <li>b2 = 0.1</li> </ul> <p>We use this neural network to predict the output of a certain input (x1=1, x2=0).

In the context of pure Python, it may refer to libraries, such as NumPy, that provide functionality for creating and manipulating tensors.</p> <p>However, in the context of this question, I suspect you may be referring to how tensors are represented in Python code, when using TensorFlow. In TensorFlow, you create tensors using the <code>tf.Tensor()</code> class, passing in a <code>value</code> (the data contained within the tensor), and an optional <code>dtype</code> argument specifying the data type:</p> <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf\n\n# creates a rank-2 tensor (matrix) with shape (3,3)\ntensor_a = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# creates a rank-1 tensor (vector) with shape (4,)\ntensor_b = tf.constant([1,2,3,4], dtype=tf.int32)\n</code></pre> <p>Once you have created a tensor, you can perform various operations on it, including arithmetic operations, matrix multiplication, reshaping, and more.</p>"},{"location":"theory_of_relativity/","title":"Theory of Relativity","text":""},{"location":"theory_of_relativity/#einsteins-theory-of-relativity","title":"Einstein's Theory of Relativity","text":"<p>Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is a fundamental theory in physics.

The theory assumes that the speed of light is always constant, no matter how fast or slow the observer is moving relative to the light source. This leads to some strange phenomena, such as time dilation (time seems to move slower for objects moving at high speeds) and length contraction (objects appear shorter when they are moving at high speeds).</p>"},{"location":"theory_of_relativity/#general-relativity","title":"General Relativity","text":"<p>General relativity expands on special relativity by describing the curvature of space-time in the presence of mass or energy. According to this theory, massive objects like stars and planets warp the fabric of space-time, causing nearby objects to be attracted towards them.
