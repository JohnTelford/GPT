Keep it in mind when reading Topics</p> Hype Curve <p>The hype curve or Gartner Hype Cycle is a graphical representation of the life cycle stages that various technologies go through, from their inception to eventual mainstream adoption. It was first introduced by the research firm Gartner in 1995, and it has since become a widely recognized model in the technology industry.</p> <p>The hype curve consists of five main phases:</p> <p>Technology Trigger: This is the initial phase when a new technology is introduced, and it generates a lot of excitement and expectations about its potential.</p> <p>Peak of Inflated Expectations: The hype around the technology reaches its peak, and expectations are very high. At this stage, there is often a lot of speculation, hype, and unrealistic projections about what the technology can do.</p> <p>Trough of Disillusionment: As the hype subsides and early adopters start using the technology, they discover limitations, drawbacks, and failures. This leads to disappointment and decreased enthusiasm, and the technology falls into what is known as the \"trough of disillusionment.\"</p> <p>Slope of Enlightenment: As more and more people gain experience with the technology and learn how to use it effectively, its potential benefits become clearer. This stage is characterized by more realistic expectations and a better understanding of the technology's strengths and limitations.</p> <p>Plateau of Productivity: The technology has reached widespread adoption and becomes an integral part of society. Its benefits are well understood and accepted, and further improvements and innovations continue to evolve.</p> <p>Understanding where a technology lies on the hype curve can help businesses and individuals make strategic decisions about investing in or adopting the technology. A technology that is still in the early stages of development may not be ready for investment or adoption, while one that is in the plateau of productivity may be a safe bet with proven results.</p>"},{"location":"hype_curve/#some-hype-curve-guestimates","title":"Some Hype Curve Guestimates","text":"<p>Here are some of my gustimates of where a few technologies are on their Hype Curve journeys:</p>"},{"location":"hype_curve/#5g-hype","title":"5G Hype","text":"<p>Big time 5G hype by major carriers, started its Hype Curve climb a few years ago starting at the Hype Curve Technology Trigger, and well on its way to Peak of Inflated Expectations</p> <p>A 2019 survey reported 5G hype is working as 1/3 of smartphone owners thought they had a 5G devices and service, but they didn't. Since then, major carriers have ramped up their hype machines and they are working. More 5G phones being are being sold now, but more smartphone owners think they have reliable 5G service, but they don't.</p> <p>A few of those with 5G smartphones are experiencing 5G service. Illinois has the top 5G availability of 27.6% of the time, representing the proportion of time those users with 5G devices and subscription had an active 5G connection. Higher urban population areas like Illinois is where the money is for major carriers.</p> <p>Some of the reasons for such service are the flavors of 5G.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Low-Band</p> </li> <li> <p>Mid-Band</p> </li> <li> <p>High-Band</p> </li> </ul> <p>The higher the band, the faster transmission speeds are, at the expense of distance and penetrating building materials. </p> <p>The High-Band has much higher speed, yet degrades traveling a few hundred feet of open space, and worsens if trees are on its path.

Ranging from levels zero to five, the driving automation spectrum begins with vehicles without this technology and ends with entirely self-driving vehicles.</p> <p>If a vehicle has Level 0, Level 1, or Level 2 driver support systems, an active and engaged driver is required. She is always responsible for the vehicle\u2019s operation, must supervise the technology at all times, and must take complete control of the vehicle when necessary.</p> <p>In the future, if a vehicle has Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automated driving systems, the technology takes complete control of the driving without human supervision. However, with Level 3, if the vehicle alerts the driver and requests she takes control of the vehicle, she must be prepared and able to do so.</p> <p>It is worth repeating and emphasizing the following: As of May 2021, no vehicles sold in the U.S. market have a Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automated driving system. All of them require an alert driver sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, ready to take control at any time.

During training, the network's parameters \u2013 weights and biases \u2013 are adjusted iteratively to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and actual outputs. This process, called backpropagation, involves taking the error gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights, and updating those weights accordingly using gradient descent or similar optimization methods.</p> <p>Applications Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other areas where pattern recognition or classification is needed.</p> <p>That conservatism stemmed in part from the unpredictability of the neural network, the computing paradigm that modern AI is based on, which is inspired by the human brain. Instead of the traditional approach to computer programming, which relies on precise sets of instructions yielding predictable results, neural networks effectively teach themselves to spot patterns in data. The more data and computing power these networks are fed, the more capable they tend to become.</p> <p>In the early 2010s, Silicon Valley woke up to the idea that neural networks were a far more promising route to powerful AI than old-school programming. But the early AIs were painfully susceptible to parroting the biases in their training data: spitting out misinformation and hate speech.

But the weak spots remained, and the history of embarrassing AI stumbles made many companies, including Google, Meta, and OpenAI, mostly reluctant to publicly release their cutting-edge models. In April 2022, OpenAI announced Dall-E 2, a text-to-image AI model that could generate photorealistic imagery. But it initially restricted the release to a waitlist of \u201ctrusted\u201d users, whose usage would, OpenAI said, help it to \u201cunderstand and address the biases that DALL\u00b7E has inherited from its training data.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Topics/AI/GPT/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<p>The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model has a large number of parameters that define its architecture, training goals, and the way it generates text.

It is a common phenomenon that has been observed in many animals, including humans, and it can occur for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>One popular theory suggests that we yawn to regulate the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our bodies. When we yawn, we inhale a large amount of air, which can help to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood and remove excess carbon dioxide. This theory is supported by the observation that we tend to yawn more frequently when we are tired or sleepy, as our breathing rate may decrease during these times.</p> <p>Another theory suggests that yawning may be a way of communicating or signaling social cues. For example, yawning has been shown to be contagious, meaning that seeing or hearing someone else yawn can trigger a yawn in oneself. This may be a way of signaling boredom, fatigue, or disinterest in a social situation, or it may be a way of synchronizing the behavior of a group.</p> <p>Overall, while the exact reason why we yawn is still not fully understood, it is likely that a combination of factors are involved, including physiological regulation and social communication.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/Meta/metaverse/","title":"(Metaverse)","text":""},{"location":"Topics/Meta/metaverse/#metaverse-news","title":"Metaverse News","text":"<p>On Tuesday March 13, 2023 Facebook parent Meta (META) announced that it will lay off another 10,000 employees.

This is known as the principle of action and reaction, which is based on Newton's Third Law of Motion. According to this law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, when a rocket expels mass in one direction, the rocket experiences a force in the opposite direction. This force propels the rocket forward.</p> <p>There are two main types of rocket engines: liquid rocket engines and solid rocket engines.</p> <p>Liquid rocket engines use liquid propellants that are stored in tanks within the rocket. These propellants consist of a fuel and an oxidizer that are stored separately until they are mixed and burned in the engine's combustion chamber. The fuel is typically a hydrocarbon, such as kerosene or liquid hydrogen, while the oxidizer is usually liquid oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide. The fuel and oxidizer are pumped into the combustion chamber at high pressure and ignited to create a high-velocity stream of hot gases that exit the nozzle at the back of the engine. This stream of gases creates thrust that propels the rocket forward.</p> <p>The design of the nozzle is critical to the performance of a liquid rocket engine. The nozzle is designed to expand the hot gases as they exit the combustion chamber, increasing the velocity and pressure of the gases and converting the thermal energy of the exhaust into kinetic energy. The nozzle also provides a means of directing the exhaust gases in a specific direction to create the desired thrust vector.</p> <p>Solid rocket engines use solid propellants that are stored in the rocket's motor. These propellants consist of a fuel and an oxidizer that are mixed together and formed into a solid block. When the solid propellant is ignited, it burns and produces a high-velocity stream of hot gases that exit the nozzle at the back of the engine. The design of the nozzle is critical to the performance of the engine, as it determines the velocity and direction of the exhaust gases and thus the thrust generated.</p> <p>Solid rocket engines are often used as boosters to provide additional thrust during the initial stages of a rocket's flight. They are also used as upper stage engines to provide additional thrust during the later stages of a rocket's flight, when the rocket is in space and requires less thrust to maneuver.</p> <p>Both liquid and solid rocket engines have advantages and disadvantages. Liquid rocket engines are more efficient and can be throttled or shut down if necessary. They are also more complex and expensive to build and operate. Solid rocket engines are simpler and less expensive to build and operate, but they cannot be throttled or shut down once they are ignited, and their performance is difficult to control.</p> <p>In summary, rocket engines are critical components of spaceflight and have enabled humans to explore space and send spacecraft to other planets and beyond. The design and development of rocket engines continues to be an active area of research and innovation, as scientists and engineers work to improve their efficiency, reliability, and safety.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/Science/Quantum_Mechanics/boson/","title":"Boson","text":""},{"location":"Topics/Science/Quantum_Mechanics/boson/#bosons","title":"Bosons","text":"<p>Bosons are a type of subatomic particle that follow the laws of quantum mechanics.

They are called \"cellular\" because the network is divided into small geographic areas called cells, each of which is served by a base station or cell site.</p> <p>Cellular networks are designed to provide wide area coverage and support high-speed data transmission, enabling users to access the Internet, make voice calls, send and receive text messages, and use various mobile applications. These networks use various technologies such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and 5G.</p> <p>The GSM technology is the most widely used cellular technology worldwide, and it uses a combination of time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) to enable multiple users to share the same frequency band. The CDMA technology, on the other hand, uses a spread spectrum technique to enable multiple users to share the same frequency band, and it is commonly used in the United States and parts of Asia.</p> <p>LTE is a 4G cellular technology that offers higher data rates and lower latency than its predecessors. It uses a different modulation scheme than GSM and CDMA, and it is designed to support voice calls over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The 5G technology is the latest generation of cellular networks, and it offers even higher data rates, lower latency, and more advanced features such as network slicing and massive machine-type communications.</p> <p>Cellular networks are typically operated by mobile network operators (MNOs), who own and maintain the infrastructure, including cell sites, base stations, and core network equipment. The infrastructure is connected to the Internet through high-speed links, such as fiber optic cables, microwave links, or satellite links.</p> <p>Cellular networks are designed to be resilient and fault-tolerant, and they employ various techniques to ensure reliability and availability. For example, the network can switch a user's connection to another cell site if the signal strength from the current site is weak, or it can route traffic through alternative paths if a link fails.</p> <p>In conclusion, cellular networks are an essential part of modern communication systems, enabling people to stay connected and access information on the go.
