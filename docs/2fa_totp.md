## What Is 2FA TOTP

TOTP stands for Time-Based One-Time Password, which is a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism that generates a one-time password based on the current time and a shared secret key between the user and the service provider. The users enter this OTP code in addition to their regular credentials to authenticate themselves to access the protected resources.

A TOTP token is a small software program that uses a cryptographic algorithm to generate a new 6-8 digit OTP every 30 seconds or a period duration selected by the service provider. These tokens are commonly used in applications that require strong authentication, such as online banking, corporate accounts, and other security-critical systems.

The TOTP algorithm is widely recognized and supported by many vendors, including Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and RSA SecurID. It works by combining a secret key with the current Unix timestamp to create a unique hash value. The hash then gets truncated to generate an OTP code that is displayed to the user.

In short, TOTP is a more secure version of two-factor authentication (2FA) that generates an OTP based on the current date and time instead of a static password.

## How Does It Work

TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Password. It’s a type of two-factor authentication (2FA) that generates temporary passwords which expire after a certain time period.

The TOTP algorithm runs on the user's device, such as a smartphone, and is synced with the server's clock to generate a secure six-digit code which changes every 30 seconds.

Here’s how the process typically works:

1.  User enters their login credentials on the website/app.
2.  The system detects that TOTP is enabled for the user's account and sends a secret key to the authenticator app.
3.  The authenticator app uses the TOTP algorithm to generate a unique one-time passcode, based on a combination of the secret key and the current time.
4.  The user enters this code into the website/application within the given timeframe (typically 30 seconds).
5.  If the code is correct, access is granted.

This adds an extra layer of security to verify the user's identity, making it difficult for attackers to gain access even if they have the user's username and password.

### Security

Unlike passwords, TOTP codes are single-use, so a compromised credential is only valid for a limited time. However, users must enter TOTP codes into an authentication page, which creates the potential for phishing attacks. Due to the short window in which TOTP codes are valid, attackers must proxy the credentials in real time.

TOTP credentials are also based on a shared secret known to both the client and the server, creating multiple locations from which a secret can be stolen. An attacker with access to this shared secret could generate new, valid TOTP codes at will. This can be a particular problem if the attacker breaches a large authentication database.
