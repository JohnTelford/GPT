## Maxwell Equations

Maxwell's Equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields in space. They were first introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s and are considered one of the most significant achievements in physics. Here are the four equations:

Gauss's Law for Electric Fields: This states that the electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the net charge inside the surface.
$$\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$

Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields: This states that the magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero, which means that there are no magnetic monopoles.
$$\nabla \cdot B = 0$$

Faraday's Law of Induction: This states that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field.
$$\nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$$

Ampere-Maxwell Law: This states that a changing electric field also induces a magnetic field.
$$\nabla \times B = \mu_0\Big(\epsilon_0\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + J\Big)$$

Where:

$E$ is the electric field
$B$ is the magnetic field
$\rho$ is the charge density
$J$ is the current density
$\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space
$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space

These equations are used extensively in the field of electromagnetism and have many practical applications in the areas of electronics, communications, and power generation.
