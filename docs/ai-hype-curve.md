Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the hype curve for several years now, and its position on the curve has shifted over time. In the early 2010s, AI was in the "**Innovation Trigger**" stage, where it generated a lot of excitement and interest. By the mid-2010s, AI had moved into the "**Peak of Inflated Expectations**" stage, as companies and investors poured money into the technology, and there was a lot of hype around its potential.

In recent years, AI has moved into the "**Trough of Disillusionment**" stage, as the reality of the technology sets in, and there is a recognition that many of the initial promises and expectations were overblown. However, despite this temporary setback, many experts believe that AI is on track to move into the "**Slope of Enlightenment**" and "**Plateau of Productivity**" stages in the coming years, as the technology continues to mature and its true value becomes more apparent.
