### Artificial Intelligence

AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It refers to the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers and machines that are programmed to complete tasks that would usually require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision making, and understanding natural language through speech or text.

AI can be classified into three categories:

1.  Narrow or Weak AI: This is AI designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition or image detection.
    
2.  General or Strong AI: This is AI that has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It can comprehend, learn, and adapt to different environments or situations.
    
3.  Superhuman AI: This is an advanced form of AI that exceeds human intelligence and capability. It is also referred to as artificial superintelligence.
    

AI technology has been widely adopted in many sectors such as healthcare, finance, education, manufacturing, transportation, and more.
