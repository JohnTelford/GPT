The purpose of this website is quick assess to topics of interest to me, and possible others

Some topics are edited transcripts of conversations with the [OpenAI](https://openai.com) [chatGPT-4](https://chat.openai.com) product

Some [OpenAI](https://openai.com) limitations are:

    - May occasionally generate incorrect information
  
    - May occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content

    - Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021

- Other topics are from pursuing what’s new and improved in the ever changing  Electronics, Internet, Science, and Software industries. Checking out what’s new or not, a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved
   
- The [Hype Curve](hype_curve.md) helps separate reality from fiction. Keep it in mind when reading Topics
