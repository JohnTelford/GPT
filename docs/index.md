Some topics are edited transcripts of conversations with the [OpenAI](https://openai.com) [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension [ChatGPT](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gencay.vscode-chatgpt) and OpenAI website.

Some [OpenAI](https://openai.com) limitations are:

    - May occasionally generate incorrect information
  
    - May occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content

    - Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021

- Other topics are from pursuing what’s new and improved in the ever changing  Electronics, Internet, Science, and Software industries. Checking out what’s new or not, a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved
  
- 
   
- The [Hype Curve](hype_curve.md) helps separate reality from fiction. Keep it in mind when reading Topics
