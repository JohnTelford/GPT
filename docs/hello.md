# Hello Duane
 
 I think this may sums up what I have been trying to communicate to the HOA and Kappes-Miller for the last 3 years. 
  
## Washington County Information

The official legal documentation is The Washington County record CCR BOOK 1060, PAGE 566. The specification for unit 43 and unit 44 are the identical, meaning they have the same Limited Common Area. There is no documentation on file with Washington County that contradicts this legal document.
  
![Limited Common Area Units 43 and 44](img/Limited%20Common%20Area%20Unite%20%2043%20%2044.jpeg)

## Bottom Line

We are Unit 43. The yellow outline is what the HOA and Kappes-Miller have  maintained is *Common Area* for the last 3 years. This claim disputes the official legal documentation in The Washington County record CCR BOOK 1060, PAGE 566.

Our unit 43 total backyard needs to be equal unit44 and properly fenced. 


Thank you for your help
