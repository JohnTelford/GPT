sum of pandas Dataframe column
To find the sum of a pandas DataFrame column, you can use the sum() method of the DataFrame. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})

# find the sum of column A
sum_of_A = df['A'].sum()

print(sum_of_A)  # output: 6
In this example, we created a DataFrame df with two columns 'A' and 'B'. We then used the sum() method to find the sum of column 'A' and stored it in a variable sum_of_A. Finally, we printed the value of sum_of_A.

um of pandas Dataframe column dollars
Assuming that you have a pandas DataFrame called df and a column named dollars containing numeric values in dollars, you can calculate the sum of the column using the following code:

bash
Copy code
sum_of_dollars = df['dollars'].sum()
This will return the sum of all the values in the dollars column. If you want to round the result to a certain number of decimal places, you can use the round() function:

bash
Copy code
sum_of_dollars_rounded = round(df['dollars'].sum(), 2)
This will round the sum to two decimal places. You can adjust the number of decimal places by changing the second argument of the round() function.
