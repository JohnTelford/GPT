<!-- ## How Do Neural Networks Work -->

Neural Networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns. They are inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. Neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that process and transmit information. Each layer extracts features from the input data, and the output of one layer becomes the input of the next layer until the final output is produced.

Here are the steps involved in the working of a neural network:

1.  **Data preprocessing**: The input data is preprocessed to remove noise, normalize the data, and ensure that the data is in the correct format for processing.
    
2.  **Forward propagation**: The input data is fed into the first layer of the neural network, and each neuron processes the data using a weighted sum function and an activation function. The output of one layer becomes the input of the next layer, and this process continues until the final output is produced.
    
3.  **Loss calculation**: The difference between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated using a loss function. The goal of training a neural network is to minimize this loss.
    
4.  **Backpropagation**: This is the process of adjusting the weights of the connections between the neurons to reduce the loss. This is done by propagating the error backward through the network and updating the weights to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
    
5.  **Model evaluation**: Once the neural network is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using various metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
    

Neural networks have been proven to be highly effective in image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many other areas where pattern recognition is required. However, they require large amounts of data to train effectively, and they can be computationally expensive to train and use.
