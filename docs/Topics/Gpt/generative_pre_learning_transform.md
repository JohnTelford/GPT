<!-- ## Generative Pre-Learned Transform -->

Generative Pre-Learned Transform, or GPT, is a family of large neural language models that are capable of generating human-like text. These models are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, allowing them to learn the underlying patterns and structures of natural language. GPT models are typically trained using unsupervised learning, meaning that they are not given explicit labels or guidance on what to learn.

The "Pre-Learned Transform" part of the name refers to the fact that GPT models are based on a type of neural network called a transformer. The transformer architecture was introduced in a 2017 paper by Google researchers, and has since become a popular choice for building large language models. The transformer uses a mechanism called self-attention to allow the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input text, enabling it to process long sequences of text more efficiently.

The "Generative" part of the name refers to the fact that GPT models are designed to generate text. Given a prompt or starting sentence, a GPT model can generate a continuation of that sentence, or even an entire paragraph or essay. GPT models have been used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text summarization, and chatbot development.
