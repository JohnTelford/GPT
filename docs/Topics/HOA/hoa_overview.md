##  HOA and Kappes-Miller Common Area Designation

> The HOA uses Kappes-Miller Condominium Management, LLC services

---

## Overview

I think this may sum up what we have been trying to communicate to the HOA and Kappes-Miller for the last 3 years. 
  
### Washington County Information

>Lawyers Title company supplied links to the all Townhome Village @ Cedar Hills Washington County records 

The Washington County record CCR BOOK 1060, PAGE 566 specifies unit 43 and unit 44 have the same amount of Interest in General Common Elements.  The Washington County record CCR BOOK 1060, PAGE 566-571 are at the end of this document.


**Section 3.3 Unit Designation** table, page 569, shows units 43 and 44 have 1,252 sq.ft of floor space and with 1.8765 Percentage of Interest in General Common Elements. That equals 1,252 X 1.8765 = 2,350 sq.ft ownership in the General Common area. My measurements agree with this number.

**General Common Elements** page 570 states:
>Each unit shall be **Entitled To Percentage Ownership In The General Common Elements** as set forth above in Section 3.3 and shall be liable for the general common expenses in the same proportion.

We are unit 43. This arial view shows that units 43 and 44 do not have the same amount of Interest in General Common Elements. The HOA and Kappes-Miller for the last 3 years have maintained the that the 40% of our backyard outlined in yellow is General Common Elements that we are not   allow to use

### The HOA and Kappes-Miller Responses

I have spent time over 3 years collecting and sharing information with HOA and Kappes-Miller hoping to resolve this problem.

#### HOA Response

I asked the HOA to join Mary and me to look at and discuss the problems. A board member accepted and we had a productive discussion ending with the board member saying it is Common Area. I asked why, the board member did not have an answer.

I have asked this question to HOA and Kappes-Miller over the years. The few times there was a response, the answer was the same.

### Kappes-Miller Response

#### Garden Shed

We submitted an ARCHITECTURAL & DESIGN APPLICATION FORM to the HOA and Kappes-Miller on April 15, 2020 requesting a freestanding garden shed to be placed near our bedroom  wall, with clearance for building, maintenance, and winter weatherization. It was **DENIED**. 

The HOA Board and Architectural Committee said they investigated the unit property lines July 14, 2020 using a site map after reviewing the architectural request. They determined that we are not **Entitled To Percentage Ownership In The General Common Elements**“, and is not part of our property, and thus cannot be built upon.

I appealed the decision and requested a explanation including the the site map. I did not receive a reply

This “common area” was news to us. During inspection of Unit 43 we asked the buyer and seller realtors about the dividing fence separating areas of the backyard. They did not know. The HOA board member we talked who did not know why it was a “common area”and mentioned it was the realtors responsibility to have informed us.

There seems to be no document that contradicts The Washington County record CCR BOOK 1060, PAGE 566-571. How could the realtors or title company inform us? 

Kappes-Miller has informed us
>..there have been no changes to the Board’s response or decision. At this time, please be advised that we will no longer respond to any further requests for the same change to the common area.

#### Proof Pervious Owner Used The Area

The HOA and Kappes-Miller asked if I had any proof that the previous owners used the area.

I sent them this arial photo showing the previous owners did use the area.I did not receive a response. 

We asked the selling realtor to remove these items in the arial photo and more items.

Replace dividing fence with a prober HOA fence and gate at the south end of our **Entitled Percentage Ownership In The General Common Elements** area

We will then be conforming to the uniformity of Townhome Village style.
