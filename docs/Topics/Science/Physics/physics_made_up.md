## Everything In Physics Is Completely Made Up

!!! note

    Quoted from [Yes, everything in physics is completely made up – that’s the whole point](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/everything-physics-made-up/) by [Dr Katie Mack](https://www.sciencefocus.com/author/katiemack/)

>A physicist's task is to constantly create equations that keep up with our observations of physical phenomena.
>
>Everything in physics is made up to make the math work out.
>
>Physics isn’t built around ultimate truth, but rather the constant production and refinement of mathematical approximations. It’s not just because we’ll never have perfect precision in our observations. It’s that, fundamentally, the entire point of physics is to create a model universe in math - a set of equations that remain true when we plug in numbers from observations of physical phenomena.aa agends
