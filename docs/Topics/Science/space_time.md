## Space-Time

Space-time refers to the four-dimensional space that includes physical objects and events. It is the combination of three dimensions of space (length, width, and height) with one dimension of time.

### Special Theory of Relativity
The concept of space-time was introduced by Albert Einstein in his special theory of relativity. According to this theory, space and time are not separate but are part of a four-dimensional space-time continuum. The theory also proposes that the laws of physics are universal and invariant in all inertial frames of reference.

### General Theory of Relativity
In his general theory of relativity, Einstein went one step further and suggested that the curvature of space-time is affected by the presence of matter and energy. This curvature then affects the motion of other objects in the vicinity. This theory has been confirmed through numerous observations and experiments, including the observation of gravitational waves.
