## Nzb Files

NZB files are a type of file format used for downloading binary files from newsgroups. Newsgroups are online discussion forums where users can post messages and files to be shared with others.

NZB files are used as a way to simplify the process of downloading large files from newsgroups. These files contain information about the location of the individual parts of a larger binary file, as well as metadata such as the file name, file size, and the newsgroup from which the file was originally posted.

NZB files can be used with a variety of software programs called Usenet clients, which are specifically designed to download files from newsgroups. When you open an NZB file with an Usenet client, it will automatically download the parts of the binary file from the newsgroup servers listed in the NZB file, and assemble them into the complete file on your computer.

NZB files are often used as an alternative to BitTorrent for downloading large files, as they offer faster download speeds and greater privacy, as well as the ability to download files in smaller pieces from multiple servers.
