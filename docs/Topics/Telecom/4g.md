## 4G

4G cellular networks, also known as fourth-generation networks, are the fourth generation of wireless mobile telecommunications technology. They are designed to provide faster data transfer rates, higher capacity, and improved voice and data quality compared to the previous 3G networks.

4G networks are based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology, which uses a combination of advanced signal processing techniques and high-speed data transfer protocols to enable faster data transfer rates. LTE technology supports data transfer rates of up to 100 Mbps for downloads and up to 50 Mbps for uploads.

One of the major advantages of 4G networks is their ability to support multimedia services such as high-definition video streaming, online gaming, and video conferencing, which were not feasible with previous generation networks. 4G networks also provide improved network security and better battery life for mobile devices.

Overall, 4G networks have significantly improved the mobile communication experience, allowing users to access high-speed internet on their mobile devices, and facilitating the development of new applications and services that were not possible with previous generations of mobile networks.
