## Generative Pre-learned Transformer

Generative Pre-learned Transformer (GPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI) language model capable of machine learning by processing vast amounts of data, including human language. It was developed by OpenAI and its purpose is to automatically generate human-like text based on inputs provided. GPT's architecture relies on self-supervised learning, which means that it can learn from unstructured data sources without being manually pre-labeled or classified.

The latest version of GPT is GPT-3, which has over 175 billion parameters making it one of the largest models in the industry. Its large size allows it to perform various natural language processing tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering efficiently. Because of this, GPT-3 has shown exciting promise across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and technology.

## What Is Generative Pre-Learned Transform Mean

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art language generation model developed by OpenAI. It utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically transformer architecture, to generate human-like natural language text based on input prompts.

The training phase of the model involves unsupervised learning on large amounts of text data, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the language corpus. Once trained, the GPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant text sequences in response to given prompts.

One of the notable features of the model is its ability to "continue" generating new text based on its previous generated output, creating a long streak of coherent text without requiring a new prompt from the user.

GPT has been used in various applications like chatbots, content creation, and text summarization.

## Neural Networks

In the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Neural Networks (NNs) are algorithms that have the ability to recognize patterns in datasets. They are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transmit information.

Structure
A neural network typically consists of three types of layers: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.

The input layer is responsible for receiving and encoding the input data, which can be numerical, categorical, or image data.
The hidden layer(s) perform computational tasks based on the input data, and through training, learn to identify relevant features within the input data by adjusting the weights and biases associated with each neuron.
The output layer provides a prediction or classification based on this learned information.
Training
Neural networks need to be trained using large datasets of labeled examples. During training, the network's parameters – weights and biases – are adjusted iteratively to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and actual outputs. This process, called backpropagation, involves taking the error gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights, and updating those weights accordingly using gradient descent or similar optimization methods.

Applications
Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other areas where pattern recognition or classification is needed.

That conservatism stemmed in part from the unpredictability of the neural network, the computing paradigm that modern AI is based on, which is inspired by the human brain. Instead of the traditional approach to computer programming, which relies on precise sets of instructions yielding predictable results, neural networks effectively teach themselves to spot patterns in data. The more data and computing power these networks are fed, the more capable they tend to become.

In the early 2010s, Silicon Valley woke up to the idea that neural networks were a far more promising route to powerful AI than old-school programming. But the early AIs were painfully susceptible to parroting the biases in their training data: spitting out misinformation and hate speech. When Microsoft unveiled its chatbot Tay in 2016, it took less than 24 hours for it to tweet “Hitler was right I hate the jews” and that feminists should “all die and burn in hell.” OpenAI’s 2020 predecessor to ChatGPT exhibited similar levels of racism and misogyny.

The AI boom really began to take off around 2020, turbocharged by several crucial breakthroughs in neural-network design, the growing availability of data, and the willingness of tech companies to pay for gargantuan levels of computing power. But the weak spots remained, and the history of embarrassing AI stumbles made many companies, including Google, Meta, and OpenAI, mostly reluctant to publicly release their cutting-edge models. In April 2022, OpenAI announced Dall-E 2, a text-to-image AI model that could generate photorealistic imagery. But it initially restricted the release to a waitlist of “trusted” users, whose usage would, OpenAI said, help it to “understand and address the biases that DALL·E has inherited from its training data.”

## Parameters

The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model has a large number of parameters that define its architecture, training goals, and the way it generates text. These parameters are learned during the pre-training phase of the model, where the model is trained on large amounts of text data to learn patterns in language and generate coherent text.

The main parameters of the GPT model include:

Embedding size: The size of the vector used to represent each word in the model. Usually set to 768 in the case of GPT models.

Hidden size: The size of the hidden layer used in the transformer blocks to perform computations on the input. It is usually set to 768 as well.

Number of layers: The number of transformer blocks stacked on top of each other to create the GPT model. Currently, GPT-2 uses 12 or 24 layers depending on the variant.

Attention heads: The number of parallel attention mechanisms used in the self-attention mechanism in the transformer block. Set to 12 in the case of GPT-2 models.

Vocabulary size: The number of unique tokens in the pre-training corpus, which defines the size of the embedding matrix.

Dropout rate: The probability of dropping out nodes from the transformation layers during training. Typically set to 0.1 for GPT models.

These parameters altogether determine the size, capacity and efficiency of the GPT model as well as its performance in generating coherent and natural language text.

### How Parameters Work

In machine learning, parameters represent the weights and biases that the model uses to make predictions on new data. These values are learned during the training process to minimize the error between the predicted output of the model and the actual target values.

There are different types of machine learning models, each with its own set of parameters which vary depending on the complexity of the model. For example, in a linear regression model, there are two parameters: the slope and the intercept. In a neural network, there can be thousands or even millions of parameters representing the weights on the connections between neurons in the network.

During the training process, the model iteratively adjusts these parameters to reduce the error between the predicted output of the model and the actual target values. This is done by computing the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the target value. The gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters are then computed using backpropagation, and the parameters are updated accordingly using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Once the training process is complete, the learned parameters are used to make predictions on new data. Because these parameters have been optimized during training, the model should be able to generalize well to unseen data, making accurate predictions in most cases.
