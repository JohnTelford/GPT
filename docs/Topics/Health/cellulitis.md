### What Is Cellulitis

Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that affects the deeper layers of skin and the tissues beneath the skin. It can occur anywhere on the body but most commonly affects the legs, arms, and face.

Cellulitis typically starts as a small red or pink area of skin that gradually spreads, becoming swollen, warm, and painful. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, and swollen lymph nodes.

Cellulitis is caused by bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, entering the skin through a cut, scrape, or other opening. It can also occur in areas where the skin is already damaged, such as with eczema or a surgical wound.

If left untreated, cellulitis can lead to serious complications, such as sepsis, gangrene, or lymphangitis. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to fight the bacterial infection and may require hospitalization in severe cases.
