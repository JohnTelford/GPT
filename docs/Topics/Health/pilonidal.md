## Pilonidal Cyst

A pilonidal cyst is a type of skin condition that occurs at the top of the buttocks, near the tailbone. It is formed when hair and skin debris get trapped in a small depression or pit in the skin in that area, leading to an infection.

The cyst appears as a small, painful lump or swelling that can become red and inflamed. Sometimes, it can also cause drainage of pus or blood from the affected area. Pilonidal cysts can be acute, meaning they come on suddenly and are short-lived, or chronic, meaning they persist for a longer time and can recur.

Risk factors for pilonidal cysts include having a family history of the condition, being male, being overweight, and having a job that involves prolonged sitting. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, pain relief, and drainage of the cyst if necessary. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the cyst completely.
