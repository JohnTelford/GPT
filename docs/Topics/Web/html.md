HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is the standard markup language used to create web pages and other information that can be displayed on the World Wide Web. HTML uses a set of markup tags and attributes to describe the structure and content of a web page.

HTML documents are made up of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets. These elements can be used to define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms, as well as to add images, videos, links, and other multimedia content.

Here's an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration indicates that this is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` element encloses the entire document, and the `<head>` element contains meta information about the document, such as the title displayed in the browser's title bar. The `<body>` element contains the main content of the document, including a heading `<h1>`, a paragraph `<p>`, and an unordered list `<ul>`, with each item in the list represented by the `<li> `element.

Overall, HTML is an essential component of web development, providing the foundational building blocks for creating and displaying web content.
