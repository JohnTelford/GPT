CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to describe the presentation or the style of a web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or XML (Extensible Markup Language).

CSS allows developers to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it easier to manage and maintain. It provides a wide range of formatting options that allow developers to control the appearance of HTML elements such as text, images, tables, and forms.

CSS consists of a set of rules, which are applied to HTML elements to specify their style. These rules include selectors, properties, and values.

Selectors: CSS selectors are used to select HTML elements based on their tag name, class, or ID. For example, to select all paragraphs in a web page, the selector would be "p", while to select a specific paragraph with a class "intro", the selector would be ".intro".
Properties: CSS properties are used to define the style of an HTML element. They include font-size, color, background-color, border, margin, padding, and many more.
Values: CSS values are used to set the value of a property. For example, for the property font-size, the value could be 16px, 1.2em, or larger.
CSS also allows developers to define styles for multiple elements at once using classes and IDs. Classes are used to group elements with similar styles, while IDs are used to define unique styles for individual elements.

CSS is an essential part of web development, as it allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive web pages that can be viewed on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
