## Web Browser 

When a user visits a website, the website's server checks the user's browser language settings to determine which language version of the website to display. If the website supports the user's preferred language, it will serve the website in that language. Otherwise, the website may default to another language or offer a language selection option to the user.

Some common web browsers and their language settings options are:

- Google Chrome: Users can set their preferred language by going to Settings > Advanced > Languages.
  
- Mozilla Firefox: Users can set their preferred language by going to Options > Language.

- Microsoft Edge: Users can set their preferred language by going to Settings > Languages.
  
- Apple Safari: Users can set their preferred language by going to Preferences > Language.

It's important to note that browser language settings only affect the language of web pages and not the language of other browser interfaces, such as menus or settings.

### Browser Languages

A browser language refers to the language settings configured within a web browser. It determines the default language in which web pages are displayed to the user. Typically, web browsers allow users to set a preferred language and prioritize them in order of preference.

There are several standard web languages that are widely used for developing web applications and websites. Some of the most popular standard web languages include:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): It is the standard language used for creating web pages. It is used to define the structure and content of a web page using tags and attributes.
  
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): It is used to style the web page created with HTML. It defines the layout, font, color, and other visual elements of the web page.
  
- JavaScript: It is a scripting language used to add interactivity to web pages. It enables the creation of dynamic web pages that can respond to user actions and provide a more engaging user experience.

These standard browser languages are often used in combination to create dynamic and interactive web applications and websites.
