Web server software is a program that runs on a web server and provides the ability to serve web pages and other content to clients who request them over the Internet. There are several popular web server software programs, including:

- Apache HTTP Server: This is a free and open-source web server software that is widely used on the internet. It supports multiple operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and more.
- Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): This web server software is developed by Microsoft and is primarily used on Windows servers. It is commonly used for hosting websites and applications built using Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET.
- Nginx: This is another popular open-source web server software that is known for its high performance and scalability. It is often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer, in addition to serving web content.
- Lighttpd: This is a lightweight and fast web server software that is often used for serving static content such as images, videos, and files.

There are many other web server software programs available, each with its own unique features and advantages. The choice of which one to use often depends on the specific needs and requirements of the website or application being hosted.
