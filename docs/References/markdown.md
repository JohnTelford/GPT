using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown
in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its
source code form

    MMD is a superset of the Markdown syntax, originally created by John
    Gruber. It adds multiple syntax features (tables, footnotes, and
    citations, to name a few), in addition to the various output formats
    listed above (Markdown only creates HTML). Additionally, it builds
    in "smart" typography for various languages (proper left- and
    right-sided quotes, for example).
