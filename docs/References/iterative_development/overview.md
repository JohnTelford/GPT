The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects. Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

 An Iterative Development Projects is a website development process involves designing, coding, and testing pieces of the application. This style of development helps speed up the website development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. 
 
Developers frequently share their work with stakeholders by creating [Private Preview Website](preview.md) for stakeholders, rather than waiting  until the end of development to find  problems. 

Other defect detection mechanisms built into Iterative Development are:

- [VScode](vscode.md) editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

- [VScode](vscode.md) fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes as they will be appear on the website while editing, and any runtime errors
