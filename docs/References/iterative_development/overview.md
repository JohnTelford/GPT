 An Iterative Development Projects is a website development process involves designing, coding, and testing pieces of the application. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. 
 
Developers frequently create  of their work for stakeholders review, rather than waiting [Private Preview Website](preview.md) until the end of development to find any problems.
