### Version Control

Version control is the primary technology for Iterative Development

- It enables multiple teams to work separately on the same project without having an impact on the work of others
  
- [Private Preview Website](preview.md) are deployed to allow stakeholders to monitor progress and provide feedback

- Version control is handled by [Git and [GitHub](github.md)](./git_and_github.md)
  
#### Git

[Git](git.md) is a popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that tracks changes in software projects and provides a unified view of project history. Developers can see the entire timeline of changes. Each developer has a full copy of the project and maintains source code integrity through branches. [Git](git.md) enables businesses to leverage collaboration and align experts. 

[Git](git.md) repositories help teams build the best product because they enable collaboration between all team members 


#### GitHub

[GitHub](github.md) is a platform that hosts [Git](git.md) repositories and offers tools for better code development, collaboration, and integration with other apps. It's useful for organizing work through repositories and facilitating collaboration through the [GitHub](github.md) flow: 

- Create Branch 
- Commit
- Changes
- Open Pull Request
- Merge

Microsoft [GitHub](github.md) is a Distributed Version Control Systems  product. [GitHub](github.md) manages an online web hosted Central Website Repository containing all project files. It offers tools for better code development, collaboration, and integration with other apps. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes, and helps answer the questions who changed what, where, when, and why for the lifetime of the project



#### Structure

The structure of [Git](git.md) and [GitHub](github.md) is centered around repositories and branches. Repositories are the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project and their revision history, represented as snapshots called commits. Branches in [Git](git.md) allow organizations of different lines of development, allowing developers to safely propose changes to the production code.

[GitHub](github.md) provides tools for collaboration, hosting [Git](git.md) repositories and offering features such as issues, pull requests, code review and integration with other apps to improve the software development process. With the [GitHub](github.md) flow, work is organized into repositories where developers can outline requirements and create branches for work on updates, before committing changes, opening a pull request, discussing and then merging changes, along with 15 million other developers worldwide.
