title: Team - Deploy
---

- Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when Stakeholders agree.

- Developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy a [Private Preview Website](preview.md) with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the Stakeholders to monitor progress. See [Private Preview Website](preview.md) Deployments

- The slightest errors or security issues during Deploy will require [Remediating](defect_remediation_cost.md) sometime during the life time of the website

#### Deploy - Prerequisites

- Decisions about resources required for deploying production version of the website to the Internet

- Decisions about resources required for team developers working on features, fixes, or testing to deploy [Private Preview Website](preview.md) websites with their changes, for Stakeholders holders to view and give feedback, without disturbing other developers work or the production version
