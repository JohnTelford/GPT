<!-- ## Minimum Viable Product -->

The first goal of website development projects is a Minimum Viable Product.

It is a way of understand whether the website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in website development where the **Must** features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

The next steps are adding the **Want** features, until Stakeholders agree the website is production quality and ready to be deployed.
