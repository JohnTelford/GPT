## Understanding Blockchain

A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties in a secure, immutable and efficient way.

Instead of relying on a central authority or a third party to validate the transaction, a blockchain uses a network of computers to process the transaction and record it on a shared digital ledger.

Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with the new transaction data, which makes it difficult to tamper with the Transaction history.

Blockchain technology has gained popularity due to its decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces transaction fees. It has numerous use cases including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, voting systems, and smart contracts.

## BlockChain Problems

BlockChain is an innovative technology that has the potential to revolutionize various industries. It brings many benefits, including decentralization, security, transparency, and immutability. However, there are also some problems associated with this technology that need to be addressed.

Here are some of the significant blockchain problems:

1.  Scalability: The current architecture of blockchain networks often limits their scalability. The transactions per second (TPS) rate for most blockchains is significantly lower compared to other payment systems like credit card networks. This low TPS rate could hinder the use of blockchain in many applications where high throughput is a must.
    
2.  Security Concerns: Although blockchains are designed to be secure, they are still vulnerable to malicious attacks. For example, if more than 51% of nodes on a blockchain network get compromised, it can lead to a 51% attack, enabling attackers to double-spend or manipulate transactions.
    
3.  High Energy Consumption: Most blockchains operate using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism that requires a lot of computational power. As a result, blockchain mining requires significant amounts of energy, increasing carbon footprint, and incurring an ethical cost .
    
4.  Interoperability: Incompatible protocols and platforms prevent different blockchains from communicating with each other. This lack of interoperability means that developers have to work harder to create new applications that interact across multiple blockchains.
    
5.  Lack of Regulations: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology makes it difficult for regulatory bodies to formulate specific regulations over its operation. It creates ambiguity in the legal status of how transactions take place and provides a safe-haven for nefarious actors to exploit the system.
    

Overall, these blockchain challenges pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. Developers will have to address these issues satisfactorily before blockchain becomes an integral part of everyday life.
